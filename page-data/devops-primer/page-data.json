When you take a birds-eye view of all the agile methodologies,\nclean-code best practices, conventions, collaboration tools, etc, what you and your organization really\nwant is to deliver value to the costumer. Ok, makes sense, right?</p>\n<p>It does! And the people from the <em>DevOps Handbook</em> even came up with this idea of a <code class=\"language-text\">value-stream</code>. Now, what is a value stream is in the first place?</p>\n<p>Quoting from the book:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the DevOps, we typically define a value stream as the process required to <strong>convert a business hypothesis</strong> into a <strong>technology-enabled service</strong> that delivers <strong>value</strong> to the <strong>customer</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/zlf5jsfw0qu2hv513xa7.png\" alt=\"Value Stream\"></p>\n<h1>The Three Ways</h1>\n<p>Right off the bat, the authors split DevOps practices into three ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The First Way</strong> enables fast left-to-right flow of work from Development to Operations to the customer. In order to maximize flow, we need to make work visible, reduce our batch sizes and intervals of work, build in quality by preventing defects from being passed to downstream work centers, and constantly optimize for the global goals.</li>\n<li><strong>The Second Way</strong> enables the fast and constant flow of feedback from right to left at all stages of our value stream. It requires that we amplify feedback to prevent problems from happening again, or enable faster detection and recovery.</li>\n<li><strong>The Third Way</strong> enables the creation of a generative, high-trust culture that supports a dynamic, disciplined, and scientific approach to experimentation and risk-taking, facilitating the creation of organizational learning, both from our successes and failures. Furthermore, by continually shortening and amplifying our feedback loops, we create ever-safer systems of work and are better able to take risks and perform experiments that help us learn faster than our competition and win in the marketplace.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The book is divided into three parts, one per way. Each part documents the relevant technical practices with supporting case studies and experiences sourced from industry behemoths like Netflix and Amazon.</p>\n<p>But this is not a book review, and for the purpose of this series I wanted to share some insights on topics I’ve found particularly compelling.
